# React Native Performance Monitor Flipper plugin

[![Build Status](https://app.travis-ci.com/bamlab/react-native-performance.svg?branch=master)](https://app.travis-ci.com/bamlab/react-native-performance)

Only Android is supported for now. Add a üëç on [this issue](https://github.com/bamlab/react-native-performance/issues/18) if you want to see iOS support.

## Usage

[Here's a detailed article](https://blog.bam.tech/developer-news/measuring-and-improving-performance-on-a-react-native-app) to go further

1. Disable *JS Dev Mode* in the settings (shake your device to open the development menu, then click settings)
2. Click **Start Measuring**
3. Do stuff in your app
4. Check the score!

This is how the score is calculated below, quite naively, but open to suggestions:

Note that:
- the score depends on the device used. We advice using a lower-end device to accentuate performance issues.
- the score depends on what you do on your app while measuring. If you do nothing, your score should (hopefully) be 100!

## Install

### Flipper

Search for `rn-perf-monitor` in the list of plugins.

### Install Android plugin

The project is not published on Maven yet, but you can install it as a local dependency:

```sh
yarn add --dev flipper-plugin-rn-performance-android
```

Then add in `./android/settings.gradle`:

```gradle
include ':flipper-plugin-rn-performance-android'
project(':flipper-plugin-rn-performance-android').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../node_modules/flipper-plugin-rn-performance-android')
```

and in `./android/app/build.gradle`:

```gradle
debugImplementation project(':flipper-plugin-rn-performance-android')
```

Finally in `ReactNativeFlipper.java`, add:

```java
